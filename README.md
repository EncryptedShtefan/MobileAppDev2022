# MobileAppDev2022

ðŸ‘‹
This app are being made for users to communicate with each other, have a better social communication with friends etc.
--
For now (11.10.2022) it is in the first stage of development and there is no architecture designed yet. 
--
Iâ€™m currently learning programming, and I think I will try Flutter (Dart) for this app.
--
I hope I will have enough spirit to develop it in any way and maybe there will be something alternative to the first idea, who knows).
